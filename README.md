# Mov-E Reviews
A collaborative site between xegativ and Tealios, made to blog our reviews of various films, shows, and books. The website only uses locomotive-scroll.js for some parallax effects and type.js for the main typing effect. Nothing else besides that. 

Run website with 
```node movie.js```
